<h1>Samantha's Top 3 Rated Movies</h1>
<h2>I will not be taking questions, comments or movie critiques at this time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>Specifically, the extended editions. From the soundtrack to the cinematography, this movie is endlessly stunning. <br/>
Great for most ages and endlessly entertaining time and again, it's a great movie for family night, date night, or just to de-stress after a long week. <br/>
<br/>
10/10, would highly recommend.</p>

<h3>The Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl</h3>
<p>With a fantastic cast, Johnny Depp always makes me smile in this movie. It's fun and fast-paced.
Another great movie for the family, as long as the kiddo's are old enough for the themes and a little violence.</p>

<h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>
<p>I don't know what it was about the second film that I loved more than the first, but I would highly recommend. 
You'd never know they filmed the movies decades apart. The director did a phenomenal job making it fresh and new, up to date with current times without sacrificing the "Top Gun" vibes.</p>
